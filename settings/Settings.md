## Twitch
To capture Twitch events, you'll need a **Client Id** and **Client Secret** and a generated auth token for your Twitch user.

### Client ID and Secret
To capture Twitch events, you'll need a **Client Id** and **Client Secret**. To create your own,
1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/login and login with your Twitch account.
2. Navigate to https://dev.twitch.tv/console.
3. Once logged in, on the left sidebar click `Applications`.
4. Click the `+ Register Your Application` button and enter the following details:
    - Name: `YOUR_USERNAME Kruiz Control` (Any name works, as long as it is unique)
    - OAuth Redirect URLs: `http://localhost`
    - Category: `Chat Bot`
5. Click the `Create` button at the bottom.
6. Click the `Manage` button on the right hand side for the application you created.
7. Copy the **Client ID** value and put it in the `settings/twitch/clientId.txt` file.
8. Click the `New Secret` button, confirm the prompt, and copy and paste the value into the `settings/twitch/clientSecret.txt` file.

### Code
Some APIs and events require a user authenticated auth code. To generate one of these, first follow the Client ID and Secret instructions to update the `settings/twitch/clientId.txt` and `settings/twitch/clientSecret.txt` files. Then follow the below steps:
1. Add the below to your Kruiz Control `triggers.txt` file to add an authentication link to your OBS or SLOBS log file.
    ```
    ### Twitch Authenticate ###
    OnInit
    Twitch Authenticate
    Error {auth_url}
    ```
2. Reset Kruiz Control (refresh the browser source) to generate the link .
3. Open your OBS or SLOBS log file to find the URL.
    - For OBS, go to `Help` > `Log Files` > `View Current Log`.
    - For SLOBS, open the settings cog (bottom left) and then go to `Get Support` and click the `Show Cache Directory` option under `Cache Directory`. Open the `node-obs` folder and then the `logs` folder. Open the most recently modified file.
4. Copy the link at the bottom of the log file, and open it in a browser.
    - The link will start with `https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize`
5. Login to your Twitch account. This provides the ability to control your stream via the created https://dev.twitch.tv application.
6. After login, you'll be redirected to a link that looks like the below.
    ```
    http://localhost/?code=YOUR_CODE_HERE&scope=bits%3Aread...
    ```
7. Copy the `YOUR_CODE_HERE` value and put that into your `settings/twitch/code.txt` file.
8. Once you have generated a code, you can remove the `### Twitch Authenticate ###` event from your `triggers.txt` file.

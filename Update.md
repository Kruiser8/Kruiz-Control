# Updating Kruiz Control

**The safest way to upgrade Kruiz Control:**
1. Download the newest version.
2. Unzip the new version into a new folder.
3. Copy all settings from the old version to the new version.
4. Fill in any settings that are new or updated.
5. Copy/Paste the `triggers.txt` and `fileTriggers.txt` files as well as the `sounds` and `triggers` folders from the old version to the new version.
6. Update the Kruiz Control source in OBS/SLOBS to point to the new KC `index.html`.

**Note:** Some triggers or actions may have been modified in the newer version. Please review the changelogs to make sure you're using the most up-to-date syntax.

## ⚠️Warning⚠️
**_We do not recommend unzipping new versions of Kruiz Control into prior Kruiz Control versions._**
